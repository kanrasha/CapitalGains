# ðŸŸª Capital Gains Calculator
Designed to work offline and with client side data custody.  Open source project.

## What It Does
A single `.csv` â†’ clean gain/loss tables (short & long) and remaining inventory.
To run the program, just run the GUI script.  There is an example CSV in place for demonstration.

## Input File Format
**`transactions.csv`:** Date, Action, Quantity, PricePerUnit, Notes (optional), Fee* (optional) <br>
*Fee column is optional as far as the script is concerned, but it is required if the price does not account for the fee*
- Source file:   imports/transactions.csv
- Clean copy:    working_files/transactions_formatted.csv
- Export:        exports/capital_gains.csv
- IRS Exports:    *this has not been made yet, but they will be formatted properly for IRS Form 8949 and Schedule D*

## Quick Start
- Download the zip
- 1: Put your CSV into imports/
- 2: Run python capgains.py (or the GUI) <br><br>
- If running the individual scripts, user must customize the paths at the top so that **`capgains[version#].py`** can locate the **`file_prep[version#].py`** script, and again for `file_prep` so that it can locate the import csv.

## Accounting Methods (toggle in settings)

- FIFO â€“ First In First Out: first units bought are first sold (default IRS).
- LIFO â€“ Last In First Out: newest units sold first (may shift gains to long-term).
- HIFO â€“ Highest In First Out: highest-cost units sold first (minimizes immediate tax).

## Additional Accounting Methods Allowed by the IRS (yet to be implemented here)
- Specific-ID (Spec-ID): this is the actual 8949 implementation of LIFO or HIFO, but can be more specific
- Average Basis Method (Average Cost): This is only allowed for mutual fund shares, and not applicable here.
