# NOTE: personal note about the syntax used here:
# NOTE: it is PEP 508 (officially “Dependency specification for Python projects”).
# NOTE: pip uses it verbatim, the same format accepted by setuptools, Poetry, Flit, etc.
# NOTE: It is not executed like a script.

# NOTE: GUI (tkinter is part of the Python stdlib,
# NOTE: but some distros split it out)
# NOTE: the following installs the system Tk GUI toolkit (and its Python bindings):
# sudo pacman -S tk            # Arch Linux and its derivatives (Manjaro, EndeavourOS, etc.).

# NOTE: Linux users may also need:
# sudo apt install python3-tk   # Debian/Ubuntu
# sudo dnf install python3-tkinter  # Fedora

# NOTE: macOS / Windows: already bundled
