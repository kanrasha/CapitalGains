II. FEES REQUIRED TO BE INLCUDED IN COST BASIS
Internal Revenue Code §1012 (cost basis): “what you paid for the property, including commissions and other acquisition
costs.”  IRS Publication 551 and Form 8949 instructions explicitly tell you to add commissions/fees to basis or subtract from
proceeds.


III. FIFO, LIFO, HIFO ACCOUNTING
Always "First Out", so each sale is calculated chronologically no matter what; method determines which purchase to sell
FIFO = First In First Out = selling earliest purchases first
LIFO = Last In First Out = selling latest purchases first
HIFO = Highest In First Out = selling highest cost basis purchases first (NOT highest price... this matters)
Specific-ID (Spec-ID) = this is the actual 8949 implementation of LIFO or HIFO, but can be more specific
Average Basis Method = Average Cost = This is only allowed for mutual fund shares, and not applicable here.

With Specific Identification you may designate any lot(s) you already own—regardless of size, date, or cost basis
and sell them in any order you choose.  You simply record the exact lot(s) (date, qty, cost basis) you are disposing of
before or at settlement, and that becomes the basis for the sale.
(See links #3 and #5 above)

That’s it. Any other method (e.g., “average cost”, “R-CAM”, etc.) is not allowed and will revert to FIFO.
